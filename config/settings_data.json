Many generations of Cornishmen toiled in these pits, producing copper, zinc, arsenic, tungsten and tin. It is said that in the 1950s, a lone minor was seen to be working in the burrows, taking two sacks of Wolfram daily to the nearby village of Camborne to sell. And so, the wheel of fortune turns and, like the rotations of the hands of a clock, time has brought a new spirit of creativity and pride to the small parish - Saint Sithney Distilling co."}},"6f998267-813e-43b0-8a6c-7602863ce125":{"type":"image-with-text","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/process_480x480_67fe66c3-4bb7-4371-b607-2c16cbf0f6d9.webp","layout":"right","heading":"OUR PROCESS","inline_richtext":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
